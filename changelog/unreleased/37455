Change: Prioritize config.php file over other configurations

Previously, in case there were several configuration files, all those files
were merged into one. If there were duplicated configuration keys, the values
were overwritten.

Now, the files are merged the same way, but if there are duplicated configuration
keys, they won't be overwritten. This means that the config.php contents will
always be present.
